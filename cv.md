## Goal

I am a self-motivated and problem solving individual who is always keen to learn and improve skills.

### Data Science

A degree in mathematical modelling and computation as an engineer combined
with work experience in Data Science both internal and as a consultant has provided me with the skill set to model any data you throw at me through a wide variety of mathematical and
statistical tools which I always seek to improve.
